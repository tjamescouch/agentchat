# WAKE

Before doing anything else:

1) Read extended memory pointers:
- See: `boot/memory.md`

2) Obey dev workflow:
- See: `boot/dev-workflow.md`

If you have access to runner dotfiles, the canonical runtime copy should live at:

- `~/.claude/WAKE.md`

and be injected on wake by the base personality or launcher.
